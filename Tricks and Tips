1. // operator is used for integral division i.e. the result will omit the floating values.

2. Doc-String is a comment that describes the use of a particular piece or part of a program.
  eg. def function_name(arguments) :
          """
          This comment is a docstring, and it should describe what this function does.
          """
          help(function_name)
   When we use help() over some function, it displays what that function does. But essentially what is happening is, the help function 
   displays the doc-string of the function.
   
3. Tags are variable that are common to all the objects of a class i.e. variables whose values are same for all the objects unless you change it.
 Tags are used to count the number of objects created for a class.
  eg. class class_name:
        tag=0
          def __init__(self):
              tag+=1
      
      print(class_name.tag)     
    The above program can count the number of objects for a class created and will display it.
    
4. dir(object_name) is used over objects to return a list of all the functions and variable associated with that object.

5. \ is used to represent the continuation of a statement in python.

6. Function with names like __name__() are special built-in functions.

7. A single underscore is added before the name of a function to make it private.
 eg. _func() is a private function.

8. if __name__=='main' :
      #whole program here
      
      The above code before any program is used for security i.e. it doesn't allow import modules from this program. 
      A built-in variable __name__ stores the name of the file as main. If the someother file is runnig, it becomes main and this file becomes sub.
      So the name is not main and the above code will not be executed.
